# Overview

The Mack Lab consists of several different computation systems each with their specific purposes:

* **[ix](ix.md)** - Our lab's local computation server. It is a multicore system with high RAM and disk space. All our projects that require lots of computation are primarily housed on ix.
* **[Arrakis](arrakis.md)** - Our lab's data server. It is a network attached storage server that provides long-term storage and backups.
* **High-performance computing** - We leverage the [Narval](narval.md) and Niagara HPC systems through the Digital Research Alliance of Canada. These systems are capable of efficiently running many computational tasks in parallel (e.g., MRI preprocessing on many participants at the same time, many iterations of computational model simulations).
